          Hi, I’m Lewis, Managing Director of Social Energy Supply, part of SE
          Group, and have been with the company since the start of 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          I run the energy supply business that focuses on providing a fantastic
          service to our smart home customers, and passing on the benefits from
          our virtual power plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously I’ve had various financial based roles in energy over the
          past decade, including Commercial Director for the business, and Head
          of Trading for Ecotricity, a leading renewable energy supplier.
        </p>
